Activity can increase briefly after stepping in a salt pile. Taking a photo of the disturbed salt pile after a wraith steps in it will give no photo rewards. Wraith can teleport silently to a player outside of a ghost event. When it does so, it will leave an EMF reading at the player location then walk back to it's room. After teleporting, Wraith can interact with objects, do ghost events, or even hunt before going back to it's room. Wraith can be found pretty far from it's favorite room. Wraiths cannot walk through walls or teleport during a hunt."},

The ghost will not show up in the actual photo. When hunting it will be more invisible while flashing than other ghosts. Phantoms like to follow players around. To help keep the phantom near its room, have all party members stick together. This will make evidence and objectives easier to get."},

Poltergeist also throws objects more often than other ghosts both normally and during the hunt. It has a 100% chance to throw an object nearby during a hunt every .5 seconds, compared to 50% for other ghosts. In the Apocalypse update, Polty was given the Oni ability to throw things harder. It can now throw things at a power of 2-6 compared to 0-3 for all other ghosts. To determine Poltergeist, make piles of multiple items and see if it throws all at once."},

If the target is outside the house, the banshee will hunt normally. If the player dies, Banshee will select a new target.    Banshee tells- Ignores non targets during the hunt. Has a unique Parabolic sound. Increased chance for singing ghost events. Ignores average sanity and can hunt when target is at or below 50%. This means that under the right circumstances, Banshee can hunt at 87% group sanity if it's target is at 50% and all other members are at 100%. Will often stalk its target while wandering. Example of unique parabolic mic sounds below. If the target is above 50% sanity, whether inside the house or not, the banshee cannot hunt."},

When it gets within 3m of the player, the Jinn will slow down. Jinn also has the ability to zap 25% sanity instantly when near the player and the breaker is on. It will give EMF reading at the breaker when using its sanity drain ability. Turing off the breaker will disable both of these abilities."},

They cannot turn lights on at the switch. Mare has a higher chance for breaking light event. It wanders more if lights are on in it's room. Mare has a chance to immediately switch off a light that has been turned on. To check for mare in NM mode, pay attention to light switching. Bait it by turning on lights and seeing if it will instantly turn them off."},

When it gains line of sight of a player however, it will instantly speed up to 3m/s. Very distinct, slow footsteps when not targeting a player.

Will more often show up in shadow form for ghost events. Less likely to show full ghost model. Ghost event chance increases the lower the average sanity gets. Will not throw objects if you are in the same room as the ghost. Boring ghost? Probably a Shade."},

Smudging a demon outside of a hunt will only prevent it from hunting for 60 seconds compared to the usual 90 seconds for other ghosts (180 for spirit). Crucifix will prevent the hunt at a 5m radius for demons, instead of 3m for all other ghosts. Demon no longer has reduced sanity drain when using cursed objects."},

If it uses its ability, it will also fully close a door in its room as a sign to check your sanity. When smudged, Yurei will be trapped in its room for a period of time. Yurei is not the only ghost that can close the door in the same fashion. All ghosts can do this, but Yurei does it more often as it also accompanies its sanity drain ability."},

(not shadow or stealth). Always pay attention to which ghost events you get. NEW Oni will now drain double the sanity when a ghost event hits you. Will now flash less during a hunt causing it to be visible for longer."},

You can get much closer to the yokai with the music box before it will break. Ghost activity is increased when talking near a Yokai."},

No Line of Sight speed increase. Hantu cannot turn the breaker on and has an increased chance to turn off the breaker. Hantu will always have freezing temps in Nightmare mode."},

It can only be heard during the hunt at a range of 12 meters or less. This now includes both footsteps AND vocal hunt noises. All other ghosts can be heard up to 20 meters away. Myling can respond more frequently through the parabolic microphone."},

DOTS will not show if a player is in the same room. DOTS will always be one of the 2 evidences given for Goryo in Nightmare mode. Goryo will not leave its room as often as other ghosts. If you see DOTS without the use of a video camera, you can rule out Goryo."},

Think of it as one ranged and one melee interaction together. It can hunt from either the melee location or the ranged location. When hunting from the ranged location, the hunt speed slightly faster (110%), and the melee location hunt speed is slightly slower (90%) than normal ghost speed. The Twins is only one ghost on the map. It can only trigger motion sensors and salt etc in it's physical (melee) location."},

To benefit from the speed increase, Raiju needs to be within 6m of any powered piece of equipment on small maps. 8m on medium maps, and 10m on large maps.  Head cams are the only powered equipment that do not affect Raiju speeds.  When hunting, electronics will malfunction at 15m for Raiju, as opposed to 10m for every other ghost. To slow the Raiju down, turn off all electronics that you brought into the house."},

All tells are with it's fingerprints. It is the only ghost that can produce 6 fingered fingerprints in addition to all other normal prints. While fingerprints will always be one of the 2 evidences on NM mode, it still has a 25% chance to not leave one when touching something. Obake can cut the duration of all remaining fingerprints in half if it uses it's ability. If Obake is suspected, pay close attention to FP. Obake has a chance to leave 6 fingered prints."},

Exercise caution! <span class='weakness'>Several reports have noted ghost orb sightings near Mimics.</span>", hunt_threshold: "The Mimic can hunt following the rules for whichever ghost it is mimicking at the time.", unique: "The Mimic will copy the behavior of any ghost type both during the hunt as well as outside of the hunt. In Nightmare mode, the Mimic will show 2 of it's 3 evidence in addition to orbs. In all other modes, the mimic will show all 3 evidence, plus orbs. Evidence is the easiest way to determine if you have a mimic however often you may notice some of the more obvious traits of the ghosts it mimics. It will change what ghost it mimics every 30 seconds to 2 minutes  and can change several times a round.  Mimic cannot change behaviors mid hunt."},

Lights and Candles do not stop the cursed sanity drain. When outside the house the curse is paused. Taking sanity pills will remove the curse. Smudging during the hunt will blind the Moroi for 12 seconds. Moroi is faster the lower your sanity is, varying from 1.5 m/s at its slowest up to 2.25 m/s at its fastest. Test...if you get a spirit box response, grab a candle and head into the house. If sanity still drains, it's a Moroi. Always has sprit box in Nightmare."},

Deogen knows where you are at all times. Hunts at 40% sanity. Super fast when far away, but super slow when close to it's target. Can change targets mid hunt. No line of sight acceleration. Has a unique spirit box sound. Decreased spirit box range for unique sound. Always has spirit box on nightmare mode. Increased chance for DOTS/writing."},

Starting very active and aging to a very slow, inactive ghost. Hunting threshold, activity, speed, and ghost event chance will all decrease the longer you are near the ghost. Starting hunt threshold is 75% dropping all the way down to a minimum of 15%. Thaye lower its speed when it ages. Starting at 2.7m/s and lowering to a minimum of 1m/s    Each age lowers the speed by 0.175m/s. No Line of sight acceleration. Increased chance for DOTS/Writing. When asking 'How old are you' on the ouija board, the Thaye will respond differently depending on it's age."}
